## What Does "No Spoonfeeding" Mean?

In this community, we encourage learning and understanding - not just copying and pasting code. "Spoonfeeding" refers to giving complete solutions without requiring any effort or thought from the person asking. We avoid this approach to help you actually learn and grow as a developer.

## Why We Don't Spoonfeed

- It helps you develop real problem-solving skills
- You understand how and why something works
- You become more independent over time
- Spoonfeeding often leads to dependency and shallow understanding

## What We Do Instead

- Guide you toward the solution
- Help you understand error messages and bugs
- Explain concepts rather than just give answers
- Suggest resources and documentation to support your learning

## What We Expect From You

- Ask clear, specific questions
- Share what you've already tried
- Provide your code and any error messages
- Be open to learning and applying new knowledge

<Accordions type="single">
    <Accordion title="Example: How to Ask for Help">
        **Don't say:**
        "how to make a ban command?"

        **Instead say:**
        "I'm trying to make a ban command. I've set up user input but I'm stuck on checking permissions. Here's the code I have so far..."
    </Accordion>
