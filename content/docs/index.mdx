#### Project Folder

Where your project will be stored - make sure to select an empty folder!

### Discord Developer Portal

Now, let's go create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
You'll be seeing something close to this:

Hit "New Application" at the upper right corner of the screen. Give it a name, read the terms & conditions, see if you agree to them, and proceed!

Now, go to the "Bot" tab

Scroll down a bit until you find a button to reset your bot's token - reset it, copy it, and go back to BMD.

Additionally, if you don't plan to mess around with your intents, go back to the Developer Portal and scroll down a bit again until you find "Privileged Gateway Intents" and enable them all.

Save the changes, and you'll be good to go!

Now, let's test if your bot is working:
Go to the top bar, look for "Bot (Offline)" and click it!
